                                <h3>Message from President/CEO and Chairman of the Board</h3>
                                <p>A young waitress in Milwaukee. A father struggling to make ends meet in Manila.  An aspiring student in Mexico City.</p>

                                <p>Each of these people wants - and deserves - the opportunity to achieve their dreams and support their family.  At United Way, more than 125 years of experience teaches us that community-wide solutions offer the best chance of helping them succeed.  That's why we are fighting harder than ever to build strong communities that allow everyone to attain their goals.</p>

                                <p>United Way goes beyond single-issue solutions and temporary fixes. Our global impact strategy focuses on ensuring children get a strong start in school, youth earn the credentials they need to thrive in the job market, and people of all ages have an opportunity to improve their economic status and live a healthy life. By ensuring that everyone has access to these building blocks of life, we strengthen all facets of society - empowering individuals and communities through holistic solutions.</p>

                                <p>We do it by mobilizing the best resources and forging unlikely partnerships. And we don't rely only on what has worked in the past. We find new solutions tailored to the challenges of our ever-changing world.  Our solutions may be similar from one community to another, but they are customized to the needs of each region - ensuring they make a defining impact in homes, schools and workplaces.</p>

                                <p>The evidence of our work is global and pervasive. In 2015, we impacted millions of lives across more than 40 countries and territories worldwide. In Florida, we led a policy change to provide health insurance to 17,000 immigrant children. We are also proud to report that our ongoing work around the globe led to the rebuilding of nearly 300 classrooms in the Philippines, connected 26,000 young people to jobs in San Francisco and helped more than 100,000 children in Mexico get a better education.</p>

                                <p>We are a <strong>network of local organizations with a global footprint</strong>, deploying what works in communities from India to Indiana.</p>

                                <p>Our fight is joined by partners from every sector of society. We foster relationships and build trust between multinational companies, labor organizations and government agencies to bring all voices and stakeholders to the table. From working with Wells Fargo to offer financial coaching, to partnering with Airbus to support struggling students, we engage our partners and their employees to improve lives around the world.</p>

                                <p>Within this report, you will find more examples of our results driven by our impact agenda. Most importantly, you will be reminded that for every program, every new initiative and every dollar raised, individual lives have been changed forever. Our society will evolve - and United Way will continue to adapt alongside it - but no matter the time or place, people are being touched because communities are choosing to come together.</p>

                                <p>That's the power of community building. That's what it means to LIVE UNITED.  To all our partners, donors and volunteers, <strong>thank you for everything you do</strong>. We couldn't do it without you and your dedication to our mission.
                                </p>

                                    <p>Every year, on and around June 21st, thousands of volunteers around the world come together to build stronger communities. We call it Day of Action, and in 2015, 388 United Ways in 21 countries celebrated it by delivering nutritious meals to people who live below the poverty line, distributing personal hygiene products and other necessities to elderly citizens, planting community gardens, and so much more.</p>

                                    <p>Day of Action is also an opportunity for passionate employees from many of our generous corporate partners to roll up their sleeves and get involved. With support from Kimberly-Clark’s Depend brand, United Way mobilized more than 5,000 volunteers and impacted the lives of more than 310,000 people across 17 U.S. cities. These, and many other year-round volunteer opportunities, are part of a larger three-year partnership between United Way and the Depend brand focused on harnessing the power of volunteers to encourage healthy, active, and independent living at all ages.</p>

                                    <p>Nearly 43 percent of the global youth labor force is either unemployed or working but still under the poverty level. There is no silver bullet for this problem, but part of any solution must be a true "cradle-to-career" continuum: a talent pipeline that prepares the next generation for the jobs of tomorrow, supplies businesses with skilled workers and builds a robust, competitive economy. That's why we're so excited to be working with U.S. Bank on the Career and College Academy, a new initiative in Minneapolis, Minnesota. </p>

                                    <p><a href="https://www.gtcuw.org/" target="_blank">United Way of the Greater Twin Cities'</a> Career and College Academy allows high school students to combine college credit earning opportunities with work-based learning experiences. Employers like U.S. Bank actually have a hand in crafting the curriculum, ensuring that students garner the skills and experience that will prepare them for in-demand jobs. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>So far, <strong>13 Career Academies have been launched, benefiting more than 200 students</strong>&mdash;students like 18-year old Casey Haas. A high school senior, Casey's coursework at the Career and College Academy counts toward a nursing degree: now she'll be starting a full-time assistant nursing job after she earns her high school diploma. She's also avoiding what could have been an additional two years in the classroom and $14,000 in college tuition.</p>

                                    <p>Over the next several years, <strong>United Way's Career and College Academy will enroll as many as 4,500 students</strong>. By partnering with our allies in the private sector, we are creating change that benefits these students and the economy as a whole.

                                    <p>In October of 2015, John Deere held its first overseas Employee Volunteer Day. With support from United Way, more than 300 plant workers in the German cities of Mannheim, Zweibr&uuml;cken, Bruchsal, and Kaiserslautern <strong>filled 6,000 bags of food</strong> for local food banks. The experience was so rewarding for John Deere and the company's employees that they are now working with United Way to expand their overseas volunteerism to more countries.</p>

                                    <p>Of course, this represents just one part of John Deere's enduring commitment to building stronger communities. In 2015 alone, their employees recorded <strong>more than 104,000 volunteerism hours in service of communities</strong> where they live, work, and raise their children&mdash;a 21 percent increase over the previous year.</p>

                                <p>United Way and labor unions have been working together since 1941 to build stronger communities. We estimate that union members <b>contribute about $250 million to our mission&mdash;every year</b>.</p>

For example, the National Letter Carriers (NALC) annual Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive is the largest one-day food drive in the nation. In 2015, the Drive collected more than 71 million pounds of food, making it the twelfth consecutive year that collections reached over the 70-million-pound mark.

                                        <p>Mr. Dominic Ng is the recipient of the 2015 United Way Tocqueville Award, the highest international honor for an individual volunteer.</p>

                                        <p>Mr. Ng is the chairman and CEO of East West Bank* and has been a member of the corporate board of United Way of Greater Los Angeles for more than a decade. His vision and passion have positively influenced the diversity of services and philanthropic endeavors of United Way.</p>

                                        <p>As the first Asian-American chair of the United Way campaign, Mr. Ng steered <a href="http://www.unitedwayla.org/" target="_blank">United Way of Greater Los Angeles</a> in raising a record $66 million in 2000-2001. He increased the number of Chinese-American donors and encouraged a different approach to building stronger communities by funding smaller, minority-serving agencies. In 2008, he helped create the "quality of life index", a crucial tool for better assessing the challenges that Los Angeles residents face and developing lasting solutions to the challenges.</p>

                                        <p>Under Mr. Ng's leadership, East West Bank has also raised millions of dollars for United Way of Greater Los Angeles' "Creating Pathways Out of Poverty" initiative, which helps individuals and families get on more solid financial ground. Through this initiative, <strong>half of the 3,000 adults who completed classes on financial education improved their financial habits</strong> within six months and over <strong>44,000 individuals and families filed free tax returns</strong> under the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program.</p>

                                        <p><i>*East West Bank, a California-based bank, was originally founded to serve Chinese-American in California and now has branches in more than 130 locations in the U.S. and China.</i> </p>

                                        <h5>Al and Barbara Siemer's dedication to helping thousands of families get on more solid financial ground has strengthened communities across the United States.</h5>
                                        <p>Today, Al and Barbara Siemer partner with United Ways in 53 communities across 30 U.S. states. Their enduring commitment to United Way's mission, and to families across the nation, is a testament to their humanity and generosity of spirit. </p>

                                        <p>When families are able to stay in their homes, children are more likely to achieve success in school and life. Al and Barbara Siemer have demonstrated a longstanding commitment to helping families stay in their homes, reducing disruptions to the lives and education of children, and empowering families to get on more stable financial ground. For their devotion to this cause, they were awarded the 2012 United Way Tocqueville Award.</p>

                                        <p>In 1984, Barbara and Al became major supporters of <a href="https://liveunitedcentralohio.org/" target="_blank">United Way of Central Ohio</a>, in their home community of Columbus, Ohio. When Sarasota, Florida became their second home community, they immediately became involved with <a href="http://unitedwaysuncoast.org/" target="_blank">United Way of Sarasota County</a> as active Tocqueville Society members, and in 1997 established the Siemer Family Foundation. The goal of the Foundation was to go beyond temporary fixes for social challenges and instead offer comprehensive solutions that will stand the test of time. It's a goal that makes them a perfect fit for United Way.</p>

                                        <p>Over the years, the Siemers became $10 Million Roundtable Members, a distinction they have earned by donating more than $10 million to United Way's mission. And yet the real measure of Al and Barbara's contribution is in the thousands of people whose lives they have changed for the better. In 2011, they founded the Siemer Institute for Family Stability (SIFS); since that time, the Institute and its partners have <strong>served 29,000 families and 58,000 children</strong>. In just the last year, 96% of families served by Siemer partners were able to avoid disruptive school moves - <strong>stabilizing more than ten thousand children in their schools and giving them better opportunities to succeed</strong>. </p>

                                        <p>Shin Won Choi knows what it takes to build stronger communities. He saw it firsthand as a child, when his grandfather shared water with neighboring farmers during a drought, and his mother set aside rice to quietly distribute to low-income families. </p>

                                        <p>The poignant lessons in philanthropy that Mr. Choi learned as a child instilled a sense of civic duty in him as an adult. In 2009, Forbes Asia recognized him as a "Hero of Philanthropy." Today, he serves as the Chairman and CEO of SK Networks, as well as a member of United Way Worldwide's Leadership Council. His support for the Community Chest of Korea (United Way in Korea) has fueled crucial initiatives to alleviate poverty, expand access to health services, and help integrate low-income individuals and families into Korean society. </p>

                                        <p>Mr. Choi is passionate about the plight of migrants and refugees. Over the years, his contributions have helped more than 20,000 individuals &mdash; most of them migrants from other countries &mdash; address issues ranging from food insecurity to medical needs and emotional isolation. He has also supported efforts to help youth who have defected from North Korea's repressive regime acclimate to their new lives in South Korea. And last but certainly not least, he joined with his fellow United Way Worldwide Leadership Council colleague Michael Hayde to create a fund designed to address the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe.</p>

                                        <p>When Mr. Choi first became a philanthropist, he chose to give anonymously, as he had no interest in seeking the limelight for himself. When he realized just how low the rate of individual giving was in South Korea, he decided to step up and become a much-needed role model to inspire others. In that sense, Mr. Choi's contribution to United Way's mission goes way beyond his own individual giving. As Chairman of the National Honor Society, for example, he helped expand membership from 200 donors to more than 1,250. By inspiring others to give, Mr. Choi has created a legacy of change that honors his grandfather and mother.</p>

                                        <h5>Michael and Laura Hayde's support for United Way Club Connect and their role in the creation of United Way France have been indispensable to United Way's mission.</h5>

                                        <p>In 2015, Michael Hayde returned to his home neighborhood of Compton in Los Angeles County, California to cut the ribbon on a new United Way Club Connect at one of the local schools. A $150,000 donation from Michael and his wife Laura supports 15 United Way Club Connects in the area. </p>

                                        <p>United Way's Club Connect Adopt-A-School Program allows donors to adopt an elementary school serving low-income students. For $10,000 per year, an adopted school received much needed resources like books, online reading resources and parent engagement tools. </p>

                                        <p>Laura and Michael are also investing in an expansion of Club Connect into Canada and New Zealand. With the support of donors like Laura and Michael, United Way's 85 schools in 15 states have adopted United Way Club Connect, <b>45,000 books have been donated and more than 42,500 students have benefited</b>. </p>

                                        <p>Today, Michael is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Western National Group* and a longtime supporter of United Way. Laura and Michael do more than give back; they strategically direct dollars toward long-term solutions that lift up entire communities. </p>

                                        <p>In 2013, United Way honored Michael with the Alexis de Tocqueville Award, our highest distinction for philanthropic giving. Michael earned special recognition for his role as a member of United Way's $10 Million Roundtable for his tireless efforts to connect other donors with our mission and for the very tangible impact his contributions have made on thousands of people's lives. </p>

                                        <p>In his home state of California, his wife, Laura supported a partnership between United Way and the California Apartment Association that aims to reduce the number of homeless and housing insecure children by half in the next ten years. </p>

                                        <p>Overseas, he was a founding member of <a href="http://www.unitedway.fr/en" target="_blank">United Way France</a>, which now champions the Airbus Flying Challenge, a mentoring initiative in partnership with Airbus Corporate Foundation. The initiative has now expanded to Kansas, Alabama, Spain and Germany. So far, <b>more than 1,700 students have benefited</b> from the Airbus Flying Challenge initiative.</p>

                                    <p>Adriana Lopez was born and raised in Mexico but immigrated to Utah in search of opportunities for her and her family. Once here, she quickly realized that in order to reach her full potential, she needed to learn English and acquire skills necessary for employment. After she advanced through adult education classes at Guadalupe Community School, she decided to stay at the school - not as a student but to give back as a volunteer. Now, she works to help families, many of which are like hers, to ensure they have access to the valuable resources they need in order to be successful.</p>
